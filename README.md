# Biometric Authentication

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing biometric authentication in social media application to enhance security and provide a seamless user experience. Biometric authentication method, such as fingerprint will be integrated into the application to replace traditional password-based authentication. The project aims to explore the benefits of biometrics and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the overall security posture of social media applications.

## Features
 **Biometric Integration:** Implement biometric authentication methods, such as fingerprint, using the Android Biometric API.
 **Secure Storage:** Utilize Android's secure storage mechanisms, such as the Keystore system, to securely store sensitive user data, such as encryption keys.
 **User Enrollment:** Develop a user enrollment process to register biometric data securely and associate it with the user's account.
 **Authentication Flow:** Implement a seamless authentication flow that allows users to authenticate using their biometric data instead of traditional passwords.
 **Error Handling:** Handle various scenarios, such as failed biometric authentication attempts or device compatibility issues, gracefully and provide informative error messages to users.

## Installation and Configuration
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Configure the required dependencies and SDK versions in the `build.gradle` file.
4. Set up the necessary permissions and features in the AndroidManifest.xml file.
5. Build and run the application on an Android device or emulator.

## Usage
1. Launch the application on an Android device.
2. Navigate to the authentication screen.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to enroll your biometric data.
4. Once enrolled, you can use your biometric data (fingerprint, face, etc.) to authenticate and access the application's features securely.
## Acknowledgments
We would like to express our gratitude to the Android development community for their valuable resources and documentation that contributed to the successful implementation of biometric authentication in this project.
